### Repository Contents
This repository contains directories and files for:
- `Labs/` - Labs 1 though 14

### Access
This repository is a **private** repository that only you, the instructor, and (if applicable) the teaching assistant have regular access to.

### Initial Set-up
At the beginning of the semester, you should clone this repository to the computer or computers you intend to use for coursework. Make sure to sync your repositories regularly if you are using more than one computer.

### Continued Use
As you tackle individual assignments, create a new `.Rproj` file in the existing lab folder and delete the `.gitkeep` file after you have done that. Remember to commit your changes and push them as you work!
